This project aims to list EVERY device and ALL its compatible roms in a big table


The table used: https://www.ag-grid.com/react-data-grid/getting-started/


The list of android devices: https://storage.googleapis.com/play_public/supported_devices.html

The original repo of ROM list, updated in current repo: https://github.com/musabcel/android_rom_list

For the future maybe:

A website that could be used to get more smartphones datas: gsmarena.com or phonedb

A script to gather the datas from phonedb: https://github.com/Warren772/phonedb.py
